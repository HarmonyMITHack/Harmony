## Project Description
Our team came together during the **MIT for Reality Hack 2025** through a shared passion for music and a vision to make it more accessible to everyone. While many people love music, it remains inaccesible to some—whether due to a lack of musical training or mobility limitations. Traditional instruments can be challenging or even impossible for those individuals to play, making co-music-making even more difficult. 

To bridge this gap, we designed **SpicyTracks**: a new music-making experience inspired by the kitchen. Kitchens are spaces of creativity, learning, and experimentation—often used in cognitive training. This approach makes music more inclusive and accessible to a wider audience. Plus, it’s fun and boosts mental well-being!
